# DELHI METRO 


The Java program allows users to input the source station and destination station of the Delhi Metro. It then calculates and displays the fare for the journey and the shortest metro route to reach the destination. Additionally, the program includes a user-friendly metro map to help commuters navigate the metro system more efficiently.

The graph comprises nodes and edges, where nodes represent metro stations containing essential information such as the station name, its metro corridor, and the lines it connects. Edges, which represent connections between nodes, signify the distance between two stations, and the cost of each edge corresponds to the distance between the two connecting stations (nodes).

To find the shortest path between the source station and the destination station, different algorithms such as Dijkstra's, breadth-first search, depth-first search, etc., are employed. By using these algorithms, the program determines the most efficient metro route between the two stations. Subsequently, the fare is calculated based on the total distance between the source and destination stations. The calculated metro route and the total fare are then displayed to the user.

Main.java cointains all the major code and Heap.java contains heap implementation.
